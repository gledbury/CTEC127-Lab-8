## Overview

This assignment counts for **two lab assignments**. In Canvas they will be identified as **Lab No. 8** and **Lab No. 9**.

This lab will have you take the **Temperature Converter** PHP code provided in [lab8.php](lab8.php) and will have you create a version of the page that employs Bootstrap 4 layout and design features.

## Instructions

- Include a Bootstrap navigation [navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) at the top of the page. Format the bar to match the design of the rest of your page. Include some links in the navbar to 3 sites of your choice.
- Place the function code into a external file such as functions.inc.php go ahead and do so. Be sure to place the code in an **inc** folder.
- Place as much code as you can in include files. This will help keep the lab8.php code easy to ready and understand.
- You will need to wire-up the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript. Look at other code examples from this class in case you forgot how to do it.
- Include a Jumbotron that gives the user info about your awesome temperature converter.
- Format all of the labels and form fields using Bootstrap styling.
- Format the select tags using Bootstrap classes as well.
- Format the button using Bootstrap button classes.
- Make sure the form is responsive and looks good at all of the Bootstrap breakpoints.
- Below the form, place two columns that are each 6 columns wide that contain the formulas being used for the temperature conversions. Place the formulas in the left column and in the right column put some info about Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin temperatures. Be sure to also include a heading in each column.
- Use any other Bootstrap assets that you want to make your page look great and work as expected.
